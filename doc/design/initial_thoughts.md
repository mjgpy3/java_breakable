# What do I want to accomplish?

Ease of use programming language, that is nerdy beyond compare

# Goals
 - Easy to type
 - Naturally DSL fantastic
 - Typing is heavily inferred, far less ritual
 - Language is opinionated but not heavily...
 -- Not really sure what this means in practice
 - JVM-compliant (because it's everywhere and it's not C/C++)
 - Heavy LISP, Ruby, Python, SML/Haskell influences

Thoughts:
```
map inc items
```

Or
```
items.map [i, i + 1]
```

```
inc i = i + 1
```

Or
```
inc = [i, i + 1]
```
